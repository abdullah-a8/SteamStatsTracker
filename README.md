# Game Achievement Tracker for Steam
This project is my semester-long assignment for the Database Systems course. Itâ€™s a web application that connects to the Steamworks Web API to display visual insights into game achievements and playtime stats for Steam users. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js), the app lets users track their progress and compare achievements with others. The focus is on creating a user-friendly and visually engaging experience while applying concepts from both database management and full-stack development. This project combines my academic learning with my interest in gaming.
